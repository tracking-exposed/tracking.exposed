  description="Due esempi di bias algoritmici: la polarizzazione su Youtube e l'eteronomartività su Pornhub. Gli algoritmi sono una soluzione tecnologica al sovraccarico di informazioni: sono tanto potenti quanto necessari per gestire l'overflow di dati che ci raggiunge. Purtroppo, possono anche nascondere l'uso di valutazioni e giudizi basati su bias che hanno un impatto sulla diffusione delle idee e della cultura. Tracking Exposed si occupa da diversi anni di rendere queste black box analizzabili in modo indipendente, sia per le ricercatrici che per utenti comuni. In questo intervento discuteremo due degli studi più recenti che abbiamo condotto sugli algoritmi di raccomandazione di Youtube e Pornhub." >}}

  title="FIlterTube: Investigating echo chambers, filter bubbles and polarization on YouTube — DMI UvA Winter School project pitch"
  description=" Abstract:  This paper studies the construction of filter bubbles and political polarization under YouTube 's algorithmic personalization, in a time where the political division runs deep in the US and the 2020 election reaffirms the polarization. Using artificially generated personalized user accounts, we find that search results differ according to users' political affiliations, both in terms of the media type and political ideology of the channels suggested, showing some empirical evidence of filter bubbles' existence on YouTube, which possibly exacerbates an echo chamber behavior and enhancing political polarization in the US political debate.

How can we use social media as an ally for critically assessing topical subjects? How do we hold them accountable for the information that goes through them? Is social media moderation and freedom of expression compatible? -- Leonardo Sanna has been a contract doctoral student at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy) since November 2018, where he has been working on the analysis of Big Data from a semiotic perspective. His research focuses on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods for social media analysis. Currently, he is studying, on Facebook, the two phenomena known as 'filter bubble' and 'echo chamber'. In particular, he works on the data of the FBTREX group."
