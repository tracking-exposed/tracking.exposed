Although the project didn't update these entries, the Spring + Summer 2021 was an awakening list of months behind the scenes. We are developing a more robust method of algorithm accountability, more platforms, partnerships, and concepts.

All the variety of Tracking Exposed is taking shape as long as the team grew, in parallel the public demand for our kind of services grows, as so are new actors in the field.

## Spring 2021 — PAADC project successfully completed!

We participated in a fundamental fashion in the first investigation that attempted to answer, with a multidisciplinary approach never seen before, to the question "does political advertising has any impact? if yes, how much?"

With a partnership organized by the University of Amsterdam, Datactive, with Volksgrant and I&O, the researcher was composed of:
* A poll institute. They survey vote orientation to 2000+ Dutch electors.
* The same poll institute, picking them among the political spectrum, and offering to install a browser extension, a rebranded version of facebook.tracking.exposed, would collect and parse the public posts appearing on their newsfeed.
* We implemented a patch to the streamlined facebook.tracking.exposed; as explained in the privacy policy, the poll institute might link between the collected evidence and their answers to the poll; this was made by having the extension looking to a personal ID communicated via survey.
* A research team analyzing political advertising, advertising that has a political message but doesn't come from official political pages, and content published by political actors that appears on the timelines of the 600+ dutch citizen who subscribes to it.
* The same researchers were interpolating with the Facebook political AD library, which should contain all political AD and represent one of Facebook's most significant concessions after 2016 pressures.
* The journalist from the [Volkskrant](volkskrant.nl) interviewing politicians about their investment in Facebook data.
* The poll institute surveyed the 600+ citizens, checked if they somehow changed their voting orientation, and asked about political messages seen on Facebook at the end of the electoral.
* Journalists are reviewing all the data above to actually draw a line of effectiveness on political advertising via Facebook.

PAADC has been one of the most comprehensive research ever made on the subject. A multidisciplinary approach that is discussed mainly in the Dutch language, we'll leave here two .pdf from the media, containing the articles produced, and in English, there is X and Y.

  title="Europe’s leading experts on disinformation call for urgent change to the EU’s draft Digital Services Act (DSA)"
  description="Today, the EU DisinfoLab publishes an Open Letter on behalf of the disinformation expert community calling on EU policy-makers to amend the draft EU Digital Services Act (DSA) to tackle disinformation head-on, ensure stronger measures on platform accountability and more democratic oversight over our online environment. The letter has been co-signed by over 50 leading organisations and individuals from across the European Union, including, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, Reporters Without Borders, Transparency International EU and Avaaz, with a cross-section of researchers, educators, journalists, academics, and activists from across the EU and beyond. The signatories call on the DSA’s negotiators to take into account recommendations aimed at limiting arbitrary actions and inactions by the largest platforms, stricter transparency measures for online platforms, such as mandating a searchable archive of terms & conditions or ensuring the availability of disaggregated ad spend data, and a more flexible provision on data access for accredited researchers."
