          ðŸ’¡ French presidential candidates were not fairly [as respect to vote intentions / equal / ] represented in the search results of both YouTube and TikTok.

        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ’¡ Candidate popularity on social media does not directly translate in vote intentions. Ex: Lassale or Zemmour VS Melanchon.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ’¡ Certain hashtags and politicians are used to prompt the algorithm to amplify the content even if they are not relevant for the video. (Algospeak)
